This project simulates a planet with many moons which each exert gravity on each other.
The program displays the orbital path of each moon, which changes as other moons gravity
distorts it's path or collide with it. It is possible also that a larger moon will pull
a smaller moon into orbit of itself, creating a new system.

The program also allows user to add moons and change the time step:
  
  Controls: 
  	Zoom In/Out: Scroll Wheel 
	Speed Up Time: . 
	Slow Down Time: , 
	Increase New Moon Mass: +
	Decrease New Moon Mass: - 
	Create New Moon: Click and Drag

  	You can also change start mass and time step using the UI in the top left. 
	Info about the moons can be found by hovering over them
